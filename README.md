<h2 align="center"> ðŸ“±ðŸŽ¥ Video Recommendation System </h2>


â€¢	Developed a video recommendation system for short videos (e.g., YouTube Shorts, Instagram Reels), scraping data through the YouTube API, leveraging CNNs for feature extraction from video content and RNNs for analyzing user behavior patterns.

â€¢	Implemented collaborative filtering algorithms like matrix factorization and neural collaborative filtering for personalized recommendations based on user and item embeddings.

â€¢	Optimized model performance through fine-tuning deep learning models with hyperparameter optimization and cross-validation techniques.
